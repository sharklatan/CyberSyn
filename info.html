<p>In accordance with the WordPress policy, the content spinning scripts can not be hosted at wordpress.org.

<p>Don’t worry, it’s a freeware GPL script, so it’s not a premium (paid) module. Just download it, unpack and upload it into the same folder at your site where cybersyn.php is located, and the content spinning feature will become instantly available.</p>
